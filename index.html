	  <h1>Mobile Linux</h1>
		<p><strong>Linux</strong> is the most widely used operating system in most areas besides personal computing. While it's influence has been growing over the past half decade with personal computers, the same gains have not been seen in mobile devices such as smartphones, PDAs, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handheld_PC">"palmtop" computers</a>. This is, of course, excluding Android. Despite its use of the Linux kernel, it diverges from the general structure and utilities of a standard Linux environment. Yet this does not mean people are not developing hardware and software for the mobile Linux ecosystem. The following will list available devices and mobile operating systems.</p>

		Based on Alpine Linux, this operating system is taking advantage of already existing hardware, utilizing Android phones. Unfortunately many of these devices are on the older side, due to the long time it takes to port mainline Linux kernels to these devices. Android phone SOC manufacturers target a single, aging version of the kernel and never update it. This makes porting drivers for devices more tricky and time consuming.

		<h2>UBports (formerly Ubuntu touch)</h2>

		Originally started by Cononical, Ubuntu Touch was meant to be the operating system for a device that could both serve as a smatphone as well as a personal computer, by attaching the phone to a dock. Cononical partnered with a few manufacturers to build hardware specifically for these devices. After a few years of stagnation and dismal sales, Cononical abandoned the project. However it was continued by the community. It has been able to take advantage of more devices through the Android translation framework Halium.
